# SimpleCFD

Simple CFD solvers written in Fortran (linear advection, burgers, compressible Euler equations, incompressible projection methods ...)  with python plotting routines. 

[I am keeping a reasonabally well documented wiki on the various codes here](https://github.com/JOThurgood/SimpleCFD/wiki)
