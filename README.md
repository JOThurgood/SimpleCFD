# SimpleCFD

Simple (and not-so-simple) CFD solvers written in Fortran with Python plotting routines.

There is, in particular, a lot of code relating to Low Mach and sound-proof models, due to the relationship to my current employment. 

[I am keeping a reasonabally well documented wiki on the various codes here](https://github.com/JOThurgood/SimpleCFD/wiki)
