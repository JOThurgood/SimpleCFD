# CCAPS - Cell centred approximate projection solver

Solves 2D Navier-Stokes equations in one of the following regimes:
* incompressible, uniform density inviscid flow
* incompressible, uniform density flow with viscousity 
* incompressible, variable density inviscid flow with gravity

using a cell-centred approximate projection approach, with optional gradient limiting etc.
